This study provides an overview of educators’ conversations surrounding ChatGPT across the AI chatbot’s first two months. We collected posts containing the text "chatgpt", and all comments on these posts, from 25 education-related subreddits. We used LIWC and term-frequency analyses to assess language features. Results show that four subreddits had more ChatGPT-related discussions than others, with notable attention from two higher-education-related subreddits. These findings suggest future directions for investigation as ChatGPT discourse continues to unfold.
